# proffy-nlw
Proffy is a project created during Rocket Seat's event Next Level Week, where a full aplicaion is developed using front-end and back-end technology. In this project is possible search for subjects you want to learn and select the best time you want to atend for classes. It's possible be a teacher on this platform, so you'll be able to register a teacher's profile, or a "Proffy's" profile.
This is an uncomplete project, as it has no database and no server. The complete project will be on another repository.
Feel free to add a comment and suggest improvements.
